    I have always been passionate about computers, wondererd how a small piece of machine recieves instructions and implements them to the letter. I have also pondered on how programs are made, executed and maintained. when i got this chance to learn about programming I grabbed it without hesitation and decided to put everthing into it. Nowadays the business arena has embraced programming on a global scale; and so, <em>failure to learn programming will be incapacitation in some few years to come.</em> Programming is a hands on skill and so it is a plus for me.
